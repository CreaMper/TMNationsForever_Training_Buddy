## FAQ

#### Why do I need a seperatre client? Where can I get one?

Another game client is required to smoothly run a replay and do not interupt your server ranked game :)
Second client exe can be the same as a normal one.

#### I do not like how packets are using in this implementation. Is there a workaround?

No. This application monitors all incomming packets from selected internet interface. The only workaround would be an injecting a method directly to the client and retrieve a current track inforormation BUT it would result with marking this herlper as a heat. I want to have this application as safe as it possible.
