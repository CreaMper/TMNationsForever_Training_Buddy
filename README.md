## FAQ

#### I cannot set a game client!

At this moment Buddy supports only a standalone client as well as the steam version. Support for other types of client will be added in the future.

#### Is Buddy safe to play with? 

Yes! Nothing in client executable is being modified while using Buddy, therefore, there is no reason to be afraid of a ban. Every action that Buddy does can be easily done by hand by downloading a replay from TMX directly.

#### I have joined a map and there is no replay loaded. Why?

Map data is fetched using dedimania.net. Not every map is mapped in therefore not every can be loaded. 

#### Why sometimes replay does not load automatically and I have to re-join my race?

Try to change a packet listening intensity. The higher value you set, the more accuracy Buddy will have with reading all map information but remember - more intensity requires more CPU resources.
